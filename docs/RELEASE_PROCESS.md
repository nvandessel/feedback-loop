# Release Process

This document describes the automated release process for floop using GoReleaser.

## Overview

The release pipeline is fully automated with semantic version bumping:
1. Code merges to `main` trigger automatic version detection from commit messages
2. Commits are parsed for conventional commit prefixes: `feat:` → minor, `fix:`/`perf:` → patch, breaking changes → major
3. Chore-only merges (docs, ci, test, refactor, etc.) skip the release entirely
4. GoReleaser builds binaries, publishes to GitHub Releases, and updates the Homebrew tap

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install nvandessel/tap/floop
```

### Go

```bash
go install github.com/nvandessel/floop/cmd/floop@latest
```

### Manual

Download binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nvandessel/floop/releases), extract, and add to your PATH.

## Auto-Release

Every push to `main` that changes code files triggers `auto-release.yml`. Documentation-only changes (`.md`, `docs/`, `.beads/`, `.floop/`, `LICENSE`) and workflow changes (`.github/`) are ignored via `paths-ignore`. CI (Test, Lint, Build) is enforced as a required status check via GitHub rulesets, so it must pass before merge.

### Semantic Version Bumping

Since the repo uses squash-merge, PR titles become commit messages. The `pr-title.yml` workflow enforces conventional commit format on PR titles. Version bumping uses [`svu`](https://github.com/caarlos0/svu) (by the GoReleaser maintainer) to parse commits since the last tag and determine the bump type:

| Commit Type | Bump | Example |
|-------------|------|---------|
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body | **major** | `feat!: remove legacy API` |
| `feat:` | **minor** | `feat: add --tags flag` |
| `fix:`, `perf:` | **patch** | `fix: handle empty input` |
| `chore:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `build:`, `style:`, `refactor:` | **skip** | `chore: update deps` |

### Skip Mechanisms

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `github-actions[bot]` actor | Automatic — prevents version-bump commits from re-triggering |
| `[skip release]` in commit message | Batch multiple PRs before releasing |
| `skip-release` label on PR | Mark a PR as not release-worthy before merging |

### Example: Batching Changes

When you want to merge several PRs before cutting a release:

1. Add the `skip-release` label to each PR (or include `[skip release]` in merge commits)
2. Merge the PRs
3. On the last PR, remove the label (or omit the skip marker) — the auto-release triggers

## Release Artifacts

Each release produces:

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **6 binaries** | linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64 |
| **Archives** | `.tar.gz` for Unix, `.zip` for Windows |
| **Checksums** | `checksums.txt` with SHA256 hashes |
| **Release notes** | Auto-generated by GoReleaser from conventional commits |

Archives include:
- `floop` binary
- `LICENSE`
- `README.md`
- `docs/` directory

## Local Testing

Test the release process locally before pushing:

```bash
# Install tools (if not already installed)
go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/v2@v2.14.1
go install github.com/caarlos0/svu/v3@latest

# Preview what svu would do
svu current   # show current version
svu next      # show next version based on commits

# Validate configuration
goreleaser check

# Test build without publishing
goreleaser build --snapshot --clean

# Check built binaries
ls -lh dist/*/

# Test version injection
./dist/floop_linux_amd64_v1/floop --version

# Test full release pipeline (doesn't publish)
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean

# Clean up
rm -rf dist/
```

## Version Information

All binaries include build metadata:

```bash
./floop --version
# Output: floop version v0.2.0 (commit: abc1234, built: 2026-02-10T15:30:00Z)

./floop version --json
# Output: {"version":"v0.2.0","commit":"abc1234","date":"2026-02-10T15:30:00Z"}
```

**Version sources:**
- `version` — From git tag (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
- `commit` — Short git commit SHA
- `date` — Build timestamp (RFC3339)

**Development builds:**
- Built with `make build` show `version=dev`
- Include current commit SHA and build time

## Troubleshooting

### Release Workflow Fails

**Check GoReleaser logs:**
```bash
gh run view --log
```

**Common issues:**
- **Missing tag:** Ensure version bump workflow completed
- **Build failure:** Check `go.mod` and dependencies are up to date
- **Invalid config:** Run `goreleaser check` locally

### Wrong Version Tagged

If you need to delete and recreate a tag:

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v0.2.0

# Delete remote tag (careful!)
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.2.0

# Create new tag
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
git push origin v0.2.0
```

**Note:** Only do this immediately after tagging, before anyone downloads the release.

### Release Published but Broken

If a release is published but has issues:

1. **Don't delete the release** — it breaks links
2. Create a hotfix and release a new patch version
3. Update the broken release description with a warning and link to the fix

### Emergency Hotfix

For critical bugs in production:

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from the release tag
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug v0.2.0

# Fix the bug
# ... make changes ...

# Commit fix
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical bug description"

# Push hotfix branch
git push origin hotfix/critical-bug

# Create PR to main
gh pr create --base main --title "fix: critical bug" --body "Emergency hotfix for v0.2.0"

# After PR merge, auto-release creates the patch automatically
```

## CI/CD Workflows

### pr-title.yml

**Trigger:** Pull request opened, edited, or synchronized
**Purpose:** Enforce conventional commit format on PR titles (since squash-merge uses PR title as commit message)

**Steps:**
1. Validate PR title against allowed conventional commit types using `amannn/action-semantic-pull-request`

### auto-release.yml

**Trigger:** Push to `main` (code changes only, docs excluded)
**Purpose:** Automatically release with semantic version bumping from commit messages

**Jobs:**
1. `check-skip` — Evaluate skip conditions (bot actor, commit message, PR label)
2. `release` — Use `svu next` to determine version, tag, and run GoReleaser

### test-release.yml

**Trigger:** PR changes to release files
**Permissions:** `contents: read`
**Purpose:** Validate release config before merge

**Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Run GoReleaser in snapshot mode
3. Verify binaries work
4. Check for expected builds

## Configuration Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.goreleaser.yml` | GoReleaser configuration (builds, archives, changelog, Homebrew cask) |
| `.github/workflows/pr-title.yml` | Conventional commit enforcement on PR titles |
| `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` | Auto-release on merge to main (svu + GoReleaser) |
| `.github/workflows/test-release.yml` | PR validation workflow |
| `Makefile` | Local build with version injection |

## Homebrew Distribution

Each release automatically pushes a Homebrew cask to `nvandessel/homebrew-tap` via GoReleaser's `homebrew_casks` configuration.

**How it works:**
1. GoReleaser builds archives for all platforms
2. The `homebrew_casks` section creates/updates a cask file in the tap repo
3. Users install with `brew install nvandessel/tap/floop`

**Requirements:**
- `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` secret on the floop repo (PAT with repo scope to push to `homebrew-tap`)
- The `nvandessel/homebrew-tap` repository must exist

## Future Enhancements

Not currently implemented but can be added later:

- **Docker images** — Multi-arch container publishing
- **Scoop manifest** — Windows package manager
- **AUR package** — Arch Linux user repository
- **Binary signing** — GPG or cosign signatures
- **SBOM generation** — Software bill of materials
- **Release channels** — Beta/RC releases

To add these, extend `.goreleaser.yml` with the appropriate sections. See [GoReleaser documentation](https://goreleaser.com/customization/) for details.
